# Community Standards - Shabdly (कविता व्यासपीठ)

**Last Updated:** January 18, 2026

Welcome to Shabdly, a platform dedicated to celebrating poetry and creative expression across languages and cultures. These community standards ensure that Shabdly remains a positive, respectful, and inspiring place for all poets and creators.

---

## 1. Respect and Community

Shabdly is a global, open platform for a diverse group of people. We expect all users to treat each other with dignity.

### Be Kind
Harassment, bullying, or abusive behavior will not be tolerated. Engaging in harmful activity may result in account suspension or deletion.

### Constructive Feedback
Focus your opinions on the creative content, not the person behind it. All feedback should be helpful, respectful, and kind.

### Respect Privacy
Do not share the private information or personal details of others without their explicit consent.

### No Impersonation
While stage names are supported, do not pretend to be someone else or mislead other users.

---

## 2. Intellectual Property & Rights

We value the importance of copyright and intellectual property.

### Visibility
Content set to "Public" is visible on your page and may be featured on the Shabdly homepage. Content set to "Link-Only" is not private; once shared, it cannot be taken back.

### Reuse Features
Features that allow others to reuse your prompts or lyrics may be available to those with access to your work. Consider this before sharing your links.

### Copyright Protection
Be aware that local copyright offices may not protect works made primarily with AI. While you may have protection over lyrics you wrote personally, take precautions before assuming full ownership protections.

## 3. Promotion and Engagement

### Build Genuine Relationships
Connect thoughtfully with your audience and fellow creators rather than just seeking a following.

### No Spamming
Repetitive comments, aggressive following, or spamming behavior will result in warnings or account termination.

### Fake Engagement
Do not create fake profiles, buy followers, or use bots to manipulate platform interactions.

## 4. Forbidden Content

The following types of content are strictly prohibited on Shabdly:

### Sexual Content
Explicit images or descriptions and content inappropriate for audiences under 13. We have zero tolerance for content targeting minors.

### Violence and Hate Speech
Content promoting terrorism, violence, or discrimination based on race, religion, gender, or sexuality is prohibited.

### Illegal Activities
Do not promote or sell illegal goods, firearms, drugs, or scams.

### False Information
Misinformation and hoaxes are banned.
